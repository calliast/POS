# Point of Sales (POS)

The Point of Sales (POS) system is a full-stack web application built with Express.js on the backend and jQuery on the frontend. It is designed to facilitate sales and inventory management for retail businesses. With the Point of Sales, businesses can efficiently process transactions, keep track of inventory levels, and generate sales reports.

## Features

- **Sales Transactions**: Efficiently process sales transactions by adding products to the cart and calculating the total amount. Generate an itemized receipt for each transaction.
- **Inventory Management**: Keep track of product availability and update inventory levels automatically after each sale.
- **Sales Reports**: Generate sales reports to gain insights into the business's performance. View data like total sales, best-selling products, and revenue trends.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Express.js is used to build the server and handle API requests and responses.
- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using jQuery for dynamic interactions and UI components.
- **Database**: Data is stored in a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to manage product and sales information.
- **Authentication**: a session-based authentication is implemented to ensure data privacy.
